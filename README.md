This app is intended to help climbers to assess whether the certain move is within their reach. It should help to answer the question whether the climber should go statically or dynamically while standing on the ground. 

solution: walls have holes for the holds, static difference between those will help to calculate the distance

input: photo; distance between holes, height, wingspan

output: circle of reach for multiple positions - from lock-off + normal windspan



mvp: script

best result: mobile app
